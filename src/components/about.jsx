<p>Hi! I'm Boipelo Ngakane, a passionate Junior Full-Stack Developer transitioning into DevOps engineering. My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity and a desire to create meaningful digital solutions that solve real-world problems.</p>
<p>I recently completed an intensive bootcamp where I developed expertise across the full technology stack - from AI-powered applications and modern web development to data engineering and cloud infrastructure. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy the challenge of learning new technologies.</p>
<p>My approach combines technical precision with creative problem-solving. Whether I'm building an AI-powered screening tool, designing ETL pipelines, or crafting intuitive user interfaces, I focus on creating solutions that are both functional and elegant.</p>
<p><strong>What drives me:</strong> I'm particularly excited about the intersection of AI, cloud technologies, and DevOps practices. I believe in continuous learning, automation, and building systems that scale. My goal is to contribute to innovative teams where I can grow as a DevOps engineer while leveraging my full-stack development background.</p>
